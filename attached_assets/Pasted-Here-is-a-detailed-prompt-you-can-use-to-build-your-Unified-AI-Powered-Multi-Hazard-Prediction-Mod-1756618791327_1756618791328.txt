**Project Prompt:**

I want to build a unified AI-powered multi-hazard prediction system that forecasts droughts, floods, and earthquakes using satellite and geophysical data. The goal is to develop a single deep learning model that can analyze multi-modal satellite imagery and geospatial data to predict these disasters accurately and provide actionable alerts.

**Key requirements:**

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
   - Collect satellite data from sources like Sentinel-1 (SAR), Sentinel-2 (optical), MODIS, Landsat, and USGS seismic records.
   - Extract relevant features such as NDVI, soil moisture, land surface temperature, flood extent maps, InSAR deformation maps, and seismic activity.
   - Harmonize spatial and temporal resolutions across datasets.
   - Normalize and engineer features suitable for AI models.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Design a multi-branch neural network with a shared backbone to learn general Earth surface features.
   - Implement task-specific heads for drought, flood, and earthquake prediction.
   - Use CNNs for image data, LSTMs or Transformer models for temporal sequences, and optionally Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial correlations.
   - Ensure the model can handle multi-modal inputs and learn both shared and event-specific patterns.

3. **Training & Validation:**
   - Train the model on historical disaster events with labeled data.
   - Use cross-validation and region-wise holdout testing to evaluate generalization.
   - Optimize using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC for classification, MAE/RMSE for regression, and IoU for spatial predictions.

4. **Visualization & Deployment:**
   - Build an interactive dashboard (using Streamlit or Leaflet.js) to visualize predictions with geospatial overlays.
   - Provide alert generation and decision support features.
   - Optionally deploy on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Earth Engine for scalability.

5. **Deliverables:**
   - A modular, extensible AI model for multi-hazard prediction.
   - Preprocessing pipelines for satellite and geophysical data.
   - A user-friendly visualization dashboard.
   - Documentation and codebase for reproducibility.
